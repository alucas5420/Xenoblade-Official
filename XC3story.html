                <div class="center2">
                <p>Keves troops Noah, Lanz, and Eunie are assigned a special mission to intercept an enigmatic airship following a successful battle against Colony Sigma. But as they arrive, they also run upon Agnus forces, which leads to combat. The airship is shot down in the battle. Mio, Sena, and Taion from an Agnus squad arrive to the crash site simultaneously with Noah and his group. Guernica Vandham, the only survivor of the airship, steps in to break up the combat as it is happening, saying he knows their "true enemy." However, the Mysterious Enemy, a member of the group Moebius, shoots him. Before Guernica activates the Ouroboros Stone he was smuggling, giving Noah and Mio's teams its power, it attacks their teams and swiftly obtains the upper hand. After that, Noah and Mio unintentionally connect to form an Ouroboros, which Moebius claims is his natural adversary. A critically wounded Guernica orders the group to flee to the "City" at Swordmarch in order to obtain answers, and it is forced to retreat. Following their initial separation, the two teams discover they are unable to return after being attacked by their home colonies. As a result, they regroup at the location where the Ouroboros Stone was activated and unite, now deciding to follow Guernica's counsel. Additionally, it is disclosed that Mio has just three months to live as she approaches the end of her tenth term.

When Noah discovers that the Consuls use the Flame Clock to govern the colony, he uses a magical sword that Riku inherited to destroy it. The group then successfully interlinks into their Ouroboros forms to defeat and kill K.</p>

Along the way, the group frees Colony 30 from Consul Q and Colony Lambda from Consul J. However, they are startled to learn that J is actually Joran, an old friend of Noah's who was believed dead in an Agnus raid. J backs off as he mocks the gathering.</p>

                <p>Consul N devises a scheme at Keves Castle, making Ethel join forces with her Agnus counterpart Cammuravi to track down the group. Noah decides to sneak into Keves Castle and destroy the Annihilator, which the Queen of Keves is using to hold Colony 4 hostage, after the group learns of this. Ethel and Cammuravi stop the group while they are heading to Keves Castle. Nevertheless, the coordination of the party proves to be equal to theirs, and Cammuravi pulls out his left eye in response to the Consuls O and P's effort to mind control him. Ethel and Cammuravi choose to duel because they want to be free of the Consuls, which ultimately leads to their deaths. The group then kill both O and P in their wrath over Ethel's passing. After that, they beat D and J by moving on to the Annihilator and destroying it. They accidentally enter the throne room as they attempt to exit the castle and learn that the troops of Keves and Agnus are actually clones who are made to fight one another. N and the Queen, Melia Antiqua, then face them. Melia, who turns out to be a robot impersonating her, forces the party to fight her. A group known as the Lost Numbers attacks the castle before N can join the fight, taking several Cradles and providing the party with an opportunity to flee.</p>

                <div class="center2">
                <p>Following their escape from the castle, the group runs across the Lost Numbers, who are headed by Monica, the daughter of Guernica Vandham. They follow Monica to the City, which is inhabited by people who have normal lifespans and who also reject the Moebius. They are free from Moebius because, as Monica explains, they are descended from the first group of Ouroboros. She also tells how Moebius plans the battle between Keves and Agnus in order to collect the life force from the carnage and then use clones to replace the casualties in order to restart the cycle. By robbing Moebius of his birthing pods, the Lost Numbers have been attempting to thwart their efforts to resupply Keves and Agnus. There can only be six Ouroboros at a time, and the actual Queens of Keves and Agnus created them before retiring into hiding. The party is then tasked by Monica, who is aware of the Queens' whereabouts, with rescuing her daughter Ghondor from the jail beneath Agnus Castle.</p>
                
                <p>N, M, and X intercept the party's attempt to free Ghondor and the other inmates after Shania betrays them. They seal their powers and take them prisoner, but Ghondor manages to get away. N chooses to keep Noah and the party safe in order to mock them by letting them watch Mio die as her life is coming to an end. The group is taken before the Queen of Agnus—who turns out to be Nia—for execution on the last day of Mio. Noah is made to watch Mio perish while and Noah is apparently executed.</p>

                <p>After that, Noah is reminded of his previous incarnations, who attempted but failed to destroy Moebius and save Mio. Eventually, he was lured into joining Moebius by its leader Z, who offered past Noah the chance to live forever with Mio as N and M. In spite of these visions, Noah decides not to follow N's decision and returns to reality, where powerful energies prevent Noah from being put to death along with the revelation that M had secretly changed her mind with Mio's, causing M to die in Mio's place while Mio survives in M's body. After regrouping while N is overcome with incredulity and indignation that M would want to die, Noah draws the Sword of the End and defeats N, X, and subsequently Nia, who turns out to be a robotic replica that resembles the Queen of Keves. But Agnus also possesses an Annihilator, which X exposes, and then uses it to destroy a portion of the Swordmarch. Luckily, M had moved the City after warning Monica and Ghondor as well. Shania kills herself because she is angry over her shortcomings.</p>

                <p>Mio confesses that she and Noah are the physical representations of N and M's regret for joining Moebius after inheriting M's memories. Mio guides the group to Cloudkeep, where the real Nia is sleeping, using M's memories. They are ambushed by D and J, but Joran changes his mind and gives his life to murder D.</p>

                <h2>Chapter 7: Time Moves Again</h2>
                <br>
                <div class="center2">
                <p>When Nia awakens, she explains that Klaus's experiment had previously caused the worlds of the Bionis and Alrest to become parallel universes, but that they would eventually reunite, wiping out all life on both planets in the process. To prevent this, Nia and Melia worked together across the two realms to develop Origin, which would serve as an ark to save all of the information and memories of both worlds before they were rebuilt after the universes combined. But Origin was tainted by the frightening wants of the people who lived in the worlds, and Z was born. He took Melia hostage and used Origin for his own purposes, establishing the modern world in which Moebius thrives on ceaseless conflict. In order to oppose and ultimately vanquish Z, Nia invented the Ouroboros Stone. The party uses her knowledge to overrun Origin, beating N and making him realize why M wanted to die. After he has finally let go of his regrets and anguish, he fuses with Noah, much as M did with Mio. After being let free, Melia reveals that Z represents people's anxiety about the future and need for security. After Melia returns to Keves Castle, Nia and the City gather their forces—including the Castles and the City itself, which are actually enormous Ferronis—for an attack on Origin, which has started indiscriminately bombarding all of Aionios in an effort to maintain Moebius' authority over the world.</p>

                    <p>The party faces Z itself after beating X and Y. Since Z is an incarnate want, it cannot see why the party would ever deny its "endless now," which it asserts is the greatest desire of humanity. The Queens take all of the heroes the party had fought with to help them before going into battle themselves, despite its attempts to keep the group apart in order to stop them from unleashing the power of Ouroboros. Due to their manifest desires, N and M are the only beings capable of ensuring Z's annihilation. At the end of the final battle, they return in spirit form and sacrifice themselves to destroy Z for good before it can force Aionios to self-destruct in a final attempt to deny the world a future that it cannot personally control.</p>
                    
                    <p>Noah and the group decide to move forward with the reconstruction of both worlds after Z and the Moebius are vanquished and Origin is reactivated. But doing so would necessitate separating and sending the inhabitants of Agnus and Keves back to their respective worlds. Before the universes split up (with Noah and Mio expressing their love for one another), Noah, Lanz, and Eunie bid farewell to Mio, Sena, and Taion. They also pledge to find a means of getting back together. While Nia reunites with Poppi and gazes at a photo of herself with Rex, their friends, and their kids, Melia stares fondly upon Shulk's Monado REX+. Both of them are confident that they and their people will eventually cross paths again.</p>
                    
                    <p>Following the reconstruction of Bionis and Alrest, Noah, Lanz, Eunie, and Joran are reborn on Alcamoth as children in the same condition they were in when the worlds originally united, according to a post-credits sequence. Noah hears Mio's flute playing as they make their way to a fireworks display and chooses to follow the tune, suggesting that they will soon be reunited.</p>
