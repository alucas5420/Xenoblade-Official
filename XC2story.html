                <br>
                <div class="center2">
                <p>Legend has it that the Architect, who created Alrest, lived in Elysium, on top of the World Tree, with the inhabitants of Alrest. They were later driven off the land for unclear reasons. After the Architect sent the Titans to save them, all of Alrest's residents have lived on or in the Titans ever since. The Titans will eventually die and drop beneath the Cloud Sea, though, for they are not immortal.
                </p>
                    
            <p>Ten years of peace have been brought about by an armistice between the opposing nations of the Kingdom of Uraya and the Empire of Mor Ardain at the start of the game, but tensions are still very high and nearly at war's edge.
            </p>
                    
                <p>Rex, who resides on the back of the Titan Azurda, sees another Titan die in the distant when a salvage leads to an unforeseen conflict with a King Crustip. Azurda remarks that all Titans will eventually die, but Rex understands that if land becomes scarcer, this will lead to more disputes.
                </p>
                    
                <p>Then, in order to sell the items he saved, Rex goes to the Argentum Trade Guild. It is there that Bana, the Guild chairman, summons him. Jin is introduced by Bana, along with the Drivers Malos and Nia and their Blades, Sever and Dromarch, who have offered Rex a salvage job. The gang expressly asks for a Leftherian to be on the salvage team because the target wreckage is in unexplored waters. To Azurda's dismay, Rex agrees, and the group quickly leaves for the wreckage. Rex spots a ship in the distance that appears to be pursuing them as they make their way to the ruins.

                <p>Rex and the clients enter the ship once the salvage crew raises the target wreckage at the location. The group arrives to a set of doors deep within the ship, which only a Leftherian can open. The party enters the chamber after Rex unlocks the doors.</p>
                    
                <p>Rex discovers a young girl in stasis behind a sword with a bright emerald gem inside; Jin and Malos identify her as the Aegis. Rex disregards Malos' warning not to touch the crystal. Jin replies that it is best that Rex not see what is going to happen, so he stabs and kills him. Jin gives Malos and Nia the task of carrying the sleeping girl from the ship onto their own vessel, the Monoceros, as Rex dies and the sword breaks.</p>
                    
                <p>The girl mentioned before is standing next to a lone tree in the center of the silent field where Rex finds himself. The girl identifies herself as Pyra once Rex discovers she is a Blade. She goes on to confirm the Elysium legends and disclose that Pyra remembers them. Then, willing to donate half of her life energy to restore Rex's, Pyra begs him to assist her in getting to Elysium. A piece of Pyra's Core Crystal is fused into Rex's chest upon his resurrection when he accepts the offer.</p>
                    
                <p>Malos gives Nia the command to murder every member of the salvage team who is still alive after Pyra's body is taken from the wreckage so that no one would be aware of what happened, but Nia objects. But Pyra's awakening and Rex's resurrection interrupt them, and the two launch an assault. Rex is soon overcome by Malos and Sever as the salvage crew flees, but Nia and Dromarch stop Malos's last blow. The Monoceros then starts shooting at the four, and although Dromarch is able to parry the blow, he is ultimately defeated. The blast almost sends Nia into the Cloud Sea, and Rex barely saves her. Azurda attacks the ship just before the Monoceros is about to bomb Rex and Nia since he knows that Jin and Malos are persistent in their preparations. After that, Azurda flies Dromarch, Pyra, Nia, and Rex away from the Monoceros's reach. Jin declares that the Aegis' awakening is sufficient for the time being and chooses not to pursue them.</p>

                <br>
                <div class="center2">
                <p>Bana is frustrated by the job's total failure after learning about the events from the salvage team. Bana approaches Consul Dughall to discuss their next course of action after learning of Rex's flight and that they will be traveling to the Gormott Province.
                </p>
                    
            <p>There is no trace of the others when Rex and Pyra arrive on Gormott. Azurda is soon located by the two, severely injured. After dissolving in front of Rex's eyes, it is discovered that Azurda is still alive but has reverted to his larval stage. Following their discovery of Nia and Dromarch, Rex discovers that Nia is a Gormotti. Pyra's mission to reach Elysium and everything that has transpired between Pyra and him is explained to the group by Rex. Though she intends to split up after they arrive at the inn, Nia volunteers to guide the group to the Gormotti village of Torigoth.
            </p>
                    
             <p>Azurda acknowledges to Pyra that a lot of time has gone by since their last encounter as they sleep for the night. Pyra confirms Rex's previous statement when Azurda asks her to, adding that she also needs to stop Jin and Malos. Although he is aware that Rex would eventually become involved regardless of what has transpired thus far, Azurda still doubts the boy's involvement.</p>
                    
                   <p>When Nia gets to Torigoth, she discovers a wanted poster for Jin, Malos, and herself. She is furious that it doesn't look like her, so she tears it up. Then, Rex discovers that the three belong to the terrorist organization Torna. They then see a recruiter trying to connect with a Core Crystal in order to discover possible Drivers. Two Gormotti try to achieve this; one, a big, strong Gormotti, fails and becomes seriously disabled, while the other, a little Gormotti, is successful and calls forth a Blade. According to Nia and Azurda, a Driver must have a certain talent, and the Blade can only materialize if a Driver successfully resonates with a crystal (although Pyra, as the fabled Aegis, is an exception to the second rule).</p>
                    
                    <p>The trio encounters Ardainian soldiers and the fire-based Blade Brighid when they arrive at the hotel. After the troops set up ether nets, the squad is swiftly overwhelmed, and Dromarch and Nia are taken prisoner. After an unidentified projectile bursts a pipe and squirts Brighid with water, briefly weakening her, Rex and Pyra flee.</p>

                    <p>After learning about the battle, Dughall becomes furious when the troops are unable to capture the blade with the emerald Core Crystal, primarily because they are unaware that emerald is a shade of green. After learning the identities of Rex and Pyra from Nia and Dromarch, Special Inquisitor Mòrag then pays Dughall an unexpected visit.
                    </p>
                    
                <p>The Nopon Tora assists Rex and Pyra in escaping the troops' pursuit by taking them to his home via a hidden hallway. He introduces himself there and talks about how much Blades and Drivers interests him. Additionally, he discloses that he is making an artificial blade after a botched attempt to resonate with a Core Crystal left him with a three-day nosebleed.</p>

                <p>Rex assists Tora in assembling the Blade's missing components, which Tora names Poppi. Meanwhile, Rex learns that Nia and Dromarch are being held captive in the Titan Battleship that is docked and that they will be put to death the next day. In order to save the two, Rex, Pyra, Tora, and Poppi make the decision to enter the Titan Battleship covertly.
                </p>
                    
                <p>The four escape the ship after saving Dromarch and Nia. Dughall and his Blade confront them right before the exit. Rex informs Nia of the execution reports after they lose, but Nia confesses that the Ardainians intended to bring her back to their empire alive. Then, right outside the ship, Brighid and Mòrag, who turns out to be her Driver, face the team, confirming Nia's suspicions that someone created a trap for Rex and Pyra.                    
                </p>
                    
                <p>During their meeting, Mòrag tells Rex about the Aegis' past. According to legend, the Aegis destroyed three continents on its own five hundred years ago, and Mòrag intends to stop it from happening again. Rex then challenges Mòrag in combat after accusing her of wishing to use Pyra as a weapon in the conflict. Mòrag subdues the team with ease, but Rex, recalling Brighid's vulnerability to water, positions Mòrag such that, while deflecting Rex and Pyra's fire attack, she unintentionally topples a water tank, rendering Brighid immobile and enabling Rex and his friends to flee Torigoth.</p>
                    
                <p>Nia makes the decision to break up with Rex outside of Torigoth, but Rex persuades her to change her mind by telling her that he plans to visit Elysium and that the conflict there might be lessened.</p>

                <h2>Chapter 3: Our Own War</h2>
                <br>
                <div class="center2">
                <p>When Jin and Malos get back to their base, Akhos and his Blade welcome them. The trio finds a cargo of Core Crystals bound for Indol, along with Nia and Dromarch, who are now traveling with the Aegis. Akhos gets to handle the Aegis since Jin chooses to handle the shipment.</p>
                    
            <p>Even though Gormott is the Titan that is closest to the World Tree, Rex and the group understand that since all of the ships are controlled by the Ardaians, they have no means of reaching the tree. Then Tora recalls that Umon, a friend of his grandfather's, lives across Gormott and might be able to provide the crew with a ship. After assisting Umon in completing and locating the ship, the group proceeds to Umon's Shipyard and then makes their way to the World Tree.</p>
                    
               <p>The World Tree is located in the center of a tiny, impenetrable, cloudless abyss by the team. When Pyra notices a problem, she orders Rex to swiftly steer the ship away. Then the serpentine Ophion attacks the ship. Pyra makes an unsuccessful attempt to pacify the beast using psychic powers. The gang runs across the titan Uraya while trying to flee Ophion, and he swallows them along with their ship.</p>
                    
            <p>Despite surviving the incident, the squad is unable to leave Uraya's interior. They make the decision to go into Uraya in search of an escape route, and they quickly encounter three Drivers: Vandham, his Blade Roc, and his friends Yew and Zuo. A fight breaks out between the two after Vandham tries to persuade Rex to turn over Pyra but Rex refuses. Throughout the fight, Rex begins to abuse Pyra's powers, wearing her out and giving Vandham the advantage. Pyra later understands, though, that Vandham only wished to battle the Aegis and had no evil purpose. After that, Vandham takes them to Garfont Village, where he discloses that he is a mercenary.</p>
                    
                <p>Then, Vandham invites Rex to accompany him on his next assignment, which is to look into an energy anomaly close to the Titan's blowhole. After Rex concurs, the group soon finds an Arachno that was able to connect with a Blade. The group finds the source of the energy effect—a dying Titan—and defeats the Arachno. Rex has additional knowledge about the Blades' past as a result of these incidents. In fact, the demise of Titans is the source of Core Crystals. A Blade may never be destroyed because its existence is linked to its Core Crystal. However, a Blade returns to its Core Crystal and is inactive for a while when its Driver dies. The Blade loses all memories of its previous Driver when it is reactivated by another Driver. Then, recalling that Pyra had already assumed an animated form at the time of their initial encounter, Rex questions whether her original Driver is still alive.</p>
                    
                <p>When the group gets back to Garfont, Vandham finds out that Pyra gave Rex a piece of her life. He also understands that this implies that any harm done to one is likewise visible to the other. Akhos and Obrona's presence interrupts Rex as they describe their search for Elysium. Vandham decides to support Rex in combat after realizing that Akhos is a member of Torna. Finally, Akhos overwhelms Rex and attacks Pyra instead. He tries to incapacitate Pyra after realizing that any harm done to her affects Rex as well. He believes Pyra may have become mortal as a result. But Akhos is thwarted by Vandham and Roc, creating a whirlwind that prevents Akhos from using his typical combat method. Pyra's wounds are attended to, and Akhos and Obrona withdraw.</p>
                    
                <p>Fortunately, Pyra is able to recuperate with some rest. In the meantime, Vandham reflects to Rex on how Akhos and the former are similar in that they are both fighting for their beliefs, how justice is merely a pretext for conflict, and the nature of power. Following Pyra's recuperation, Nia tries to tell Vandham about her past with Akhos and Torna, but he interrupts, saying that what counts is her current partnership with Rex. In order to meet with a friend who can assist them in getting to Elysium, Vandham then offers to drive the group to the capital of Uraya. Zeke and his Blade Pandoria confront them as they are leaving, but they swiftly vanish after inadvertently destroying the portion of the cliff they were standing on. </p>

                <p>The action then shifts to Jin, who dispatches a ship heading to Indol with ease, killing all of its warriors and causing it to crash into the Cloud Sea.</p>
    
                <p>Eventually, Rex and his friends arrive in Fonsa Myma, the capital of the Uraya. They find out about the rations that have been distributed as a result of the battle with the Ardainians there. They then observe a soldier stealing a little girl's food. When they defeat the soldier in combat, they discover that the girl, Iona, is being cared for by Vandham's previously mentioned buddy. </p>
                    
                <p>After discovering that Vandham's acquaintance is the theater troupe's leader, the party makes their way to the theater. The Aegis War, which took place five hundred years ago, is dramatized for them. The armies of darkness and the inhabitants of Alrest fought the war. A hero by the name of Addam led the people of Alrest and appealed to the Architect for assistance. The Aegis was the Architect's response, and Addam and the Aegis' combined might defeated the forces of evil, albeit at the expense of submerging every continent in the Cloud Sea. Although Pyra seems to be simply interested in the spectacular stage effects, Nia tells Rex after the show how agonizing it must be for her to see a play about her past.</p>
                    
                <p>After that, the party meets Cole, whom Vandham is familiar with from their time in war. Cole finds out that Rex has taken over as Pyra's driver and that they intend to travel to Elysium. Cole remarks that it will be nearly impossible to approach as Ophion is protecting the World Tree. However, he knows of one individual who ascended the World Tree and arrived in Elysium. He offers to present this individual to the team, but first asks for some quiet time to speak with the Aegis.</p>
                    
                <p>Cole, whom Pyra refers to by his original name Minoth, apologizes for any unpleasant memories the play may have brought back and warns Pyra against using the same power that decimated the continents during the Aegis War because the world might not be able to withstand a second assault. After that, Minoth searches for a gift he had prepared for the squad, but his aging body stops him. Despite Minoth's suggestion that they return the following day, the team chooses to spend the night at the inn.</p>
            
                <p>Following the team's departure from the theater, Akhos and Malos pay Minoth a visit and offer to revitalize him in exchange for money. Although the idea excites the eavesdropping Iona, who is later discovered and taken hostage by Torna, Minoth declines. Then, in a dream, Malos tells Pyra about Iona's hostage predicament and instructs her to meet him at the location where she initially woke up.</p>
                    
                <p>The squad soon finds out about Pyra's disappearance and Iona's captivity, and Minoth understands the connection between the two incidents. Since Addam initially saw Pyra and roused her during the ancient fight at the Olethro Ruins, he concludes that Pyra must be traveling there.</p>
                    
                <p>Malos and Akhos are able to overwhelm the group at Olethro Ruins, and Akhos stops the local ether flow to render the Blades inoperable. But despite Akhos' interference, Vandham channels the ether by impaling himself with his dual scythes. After defeating Akhos and Malos, Vandham issues a warning to Rex to leave the region. Even though Akhos and Malos eventually battle and kill Vandham, Rex refuses to leave the area. Malos uses the species' appetite for violence—which is demonstrated by the warships in Fonsa Myma preparing for war with the Ardainians—as justification when Akhos discloses Jin's and Torna's ultimate purpose in the ensuing skirmish: they intend to exterminate humanity. </p>

                <br>
                <div class="center2">
                <p>A flashback to the Aegis War begins the chapter. In one battle, Mythra uses her immense power to drive back an onslaught by the forces of evil, but in the process, she destroys a village while the attack's survivors look on helplessly.
                </p>
                    
            <p>Since Azurda points out that it is customary for mercenaries to be buried near the location of their death, Vandham is given a burial and ceremony at the Olethro Ruins. Cole and Iona, along with the party, attend the burial. After that, Pyra is confronted by Rex, Nia, and Tora regarding her other identity. As Pyra tries to clarify, Mythra abruptly assumes control. She then chastises Rex for his incapacity and stubbornness, pointing out that although she made Pyra to prevent the release of the energy that destroyed the continents during the ancient conflict, Rex's refusal to leave at Vandham's order compelled her to reawaken, possibly endangering Alrest with her destructive abilities. Then, to Pyra's annoyance, she quickly gives her back control.
           </p>
                    
        <p>After giving her origin, Pyra reveals that Malos and she are the two Aegis. In his quest for Elysium, a man once climbed the World-Tree. But when he saw that the summit of the Tree was vacant, he returned to Alrest with two Core Crystals—one purple and one emerald—as evidence of his success. He later struck a chord with the purple Crystal, rousing Malos, who subsequently attacked Alrest. A warrior from the now-lost Kingdom of Torna named Addam awoke Mythra to fight Malos because she was ready. Three Titans were lost in the Aegis War, which Mythra eventually triumphed. She made Pyra, a much weaker personality who saw Mythra as a sister, in order to prevent another catastrophe of this kind. After that, Pyra fell into a deep sleep on board the Ancient Ship, and Addam locked her room and sank the ship well below the Cloud Sea to keep her from waking up. Pyra then discloses that in order to finally finish off Malos, she and Mythra intend to return to Elysium. Pyra apologizes to Rex for Mythra's actions earlier that day, but Rex tells her not to feel too bad because Mythra had some valid points. Following Rex's departure to assist Tora on Poppi, Azurda remarks to Pyra about Rex's carefree attitude, which seems to be similar to Addam's.

             <p>Cole hands Rex a Blade weapon as the group prepares to leave, instructing him to locate its owner in Indol. The Blade attached to that weapon is Cole, who is doomed to be a Flesh Eater, Rex then learns. In an attempt to create Blades with special abilities, experiments were conducted prior to the war to merge Blades with human cells. Nevertheless, the procedure was rarely successful, and many Blades eventually aged physically and lost their immortality, just like Cole. After serving in the Aegis War, Cole assures Rex that his Driver can assist the group in getting to Elysium. Cole complies with Rex's request that he write a play about Vandham's life to inspire others and present to the group upon their return from Elysium. </p>
                    
            <p>The group arranges their journey to Indol after resolving the dispute with the Garfont Mercenaries, which Vandham willed to Rex. Rex chooses to transfer via the Argentum Trade Guild and subsequently the Empire of Mor Ardain. Unfortunately, when a young Gormotti (later revealed as Rhys) takes Rex's bag, which contained Roc's Core Crystal, their intentions are derailed. After a while, the group returns to Umon's Shipyard on Gormott, where Rex successfully rescues Roc. The group then finds out that Rhys is from Cordell Village, a tiny community outside of Gormott. The majority of the people were killed as bandits looted the village. Unaware of the risks involved in trying to become a driver, Rhys intended to use Roc to exact revenge on those who were killed. The bandits are therefore preparing to assault Torigoth next, according to one of Rhys's friends, since Dughall has been removed from his position as consul. In order to confront the bandits at their hiding place, Rex asks Rhys to inform the people of Torigoth that the people responsible for the water tank disaster would be present. </p>
                    
                   <p>The company proceeds to Mor Ardain after battling the bandits and returning Rhys and his friends to Argentum. When they reach the capital of the empire, they meet Tatazo, Tora's father, and Muimui, a Nopon lab assistant to Professor Soosoo, Tora's late grandpa. When Tora asks if Muimui is aware of Tatazo's whereabouts, he responds negatively, stating that he was not present when the lab was attacked and only came back to discover Soosoo's body. Muimui does, however, apologize for disturbing the group's journey by providing them with the address of an inn owned by a friend.</p>

                   <p>Mythra learns a secret about Nia while the girls are in the inn's hot springs, but Nia requests that she not tell Rex. The group decides to explore after being startled by a loud noise as they get settled in. Mythra insists on working with Rex before they do so since he needs to understand how to harness her power efficiently because it differs from Pyra's. The group discovers that an artificial blade attacking Ardainian soldiers is the cause of the commotion. Tora identifies it as Lila, the artificial Blade that his father and grandfather were building, once they have cornered it. However, Lila is able to get away. Tora remembers that he had made his getaway with the blueprints for creating artificial Blades and a finished ether furnace on the day the lab was attacked. However, because Lila was unfinished at the time, whomever was using her had to have kidnapped Tora's father and made him finish her; hence, he was still alive. </p>
                    
                    
                    <p>The inquisitor thought Poppi was behind the earlier attacks, so Mòrag and Brighid attacked the group before they could think through the ramifications. Niranira, a Nopon from the Argentum Guild's Intelligence Division, fortunately shows up to clear Poppi's name for Rex and his companions. Since they had arrived in Mor Ardain, he had been following Rex's crew, who had traveled by using a Guild's conveyance. Mòrag expresses regret for her error and requests the group's help with the probe.</p>

                <p>When Rex and the others investigate the acquisitions of materials used to create artificial blades, they find that the buyers are transporting the items to an abandoned factory. After reporting back to Mòrag, Rex and the others head to the factory, where they run into Zeke again. Inside the plant, Tora's father Tatazo is compelled to supervise the production of artificial blades. Muimui interrupts the poignant reunion between Tora and Tatazo. Since the ether furnace that Poppi used was based on Professor Soosoo's more sophisticated designs, Muimui admits to being complicit in the laboratory attack and luring Rex's group to the factory. Bana shows up with Lila to chastise Muimui for his shortcomings after his Tirkin grunts are unable to control the gathering. Bana has already set up the plant with Senator Roderich's support, but he is selling the final products to Torna first rather than Mor Ardain. In order to obtain Poppi and the Aegis, Bana gives Lila the command to attack the party.  </p>
                    
                <p>Following Lila's defeat and liberation from Bana and Muimui's hold, the two Nopon flee to the factory's entrance, where Rex and Nia pursue them while Tora and Poppi tend to Lila's deteriorating condition. The Nopon reveal Rosa, an artificial Blade scaled to be more than twice Rex's height and created from Tatazo's plans, in the center of the facility. Tora and Poppi, who have been improved after absorbing energy from Lila's special ether furnace, save Rex and Nia when they are first overpowered. Bana tries to flee, but the group easily overcomes Rosa and knocks out Muimui. Rex demands that Bana cease producing artificial blades when the group catches up, or else he will be turned over to Mòrag.</p>
                    
                <p>At first, Bana accepts the terms, but two Tornan Drivers, Mikhail and Patroka, interrupt him. The pair overpowers the gathering, and Nia remarks that considering their skill, they are practically a little army. Mythra discovers a very particular location where she can turn Mikhail and Patroka's Blades, Cressidus and Perdido, back into Core Crystals, but she is unable to use the power indoors without running the risk of completely destroying the environment. The group coerces the two to the location where Mythra releases her powers with Mòrag's assistance. After docking the Monoceros right beneath the factory, Mikhail grabs Patroka and flees as she starts to radiate a red aura in anger over losing her Blade but is stopped by Fan la Norne.</p>
                    
                <p>After, the focus shifts to Jin, who walks into a room where a girl named Lora lies in stasis. He tells her that her moment is coming soon.</p>

                <h2>Chapter 5: Masters and Slaves</h2>
                <br>
                <div class="center2">
                <p>A flashback to five hundred years ago begins the chapter. In their camp, Addam and Lora can be seen fighting with their respective Blades, Mythra and Haze. Jin interrupts their combat since their food is ready. After returning on a mission with her Driver—likely the Emperor of Mor Ardain, who is known as "His Majesty"—Brighid then joins them. Addam feels he hasn't yet realized Mythra's potential, while Haze and Mythra remark on the innate bond between a Blade and Driver. Then, as Jin is said to be the strongest man in Torna, Addam proposes that they spar, even though Jin says he dislikes fighting. Then a soldier comes in and says Malos is coming for the capital.
                </p>
                    
            <p>Fan la Norne identifies herself as a caravan from the Indoline Praetorium, and that Mythra's Driver is being sought by Praetor Amalthus, who is in charge of all Drivers and Blades. Rex consents to a meeting with Amalthus after Fan la Norne discloses that Amalthus is the driver for both Malos and Cole. The group leaves for Indol with Fan, now including Mòrag.
            </p>
                    
                <p>Fan is identified by Mythra as Haze during the journey to Indol, but she discovers that she has forgotten that identity and is now Amalthus' Blade. Pyra and Mythra observe that Fan's resonance differs from both their resonance with Rex and the typical Blade resonance.</p>
                    
                <p>After returning to Jin with Patroka, Mikhail shares their latest endeavors. Then Mikhail says Fan la Norne must be Haze. The situation in Temperantia, where the Ardainians seem to have unearthed Judicium technology, is covered by Akhos. Jin decides to buy Torna some time by going to Temperantia.</p>
                    
                <p>Fan chooses to land at the Leftherian Archipelago and walk to another emissary on the opposite side of the region due to topographical limitations with the Cloud Sea. As a Leftherian, Rex offers to take the lead and leads the group to Fonsett Village, his hometown. Corinne welcomes them there and offers to host them for the night. After that, Rex and Pyra visit his parents' grave in Oratory Knoll Cemetery, where Rex shares with them their quest to locate Elysium.</p>

                <p>Once back in town, Corinne tells Pyra about Rex's past. Rex and his parents washed up on the Leftherian Archipelago when he was two years old. His mother only lived long enough to give Rex to Corinne, and his father passed away before reaching Fonsett. Given her terrible identity as the Aegis, Pyra considers whether it would be best for her to avoid Rex after realizing how much Rex has suffered. Brighid listens in on the chat without either of them realizing it.</p>
                    
                <p>Zeke greets the group in front of the convoy as they depart for Indol. After Zeke surprises everyone with a powerful attack, Mòrag reveals that he is the Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Tantal. Zeke admits that he has been acting as a special envoy from Indol to test the Aegis and her Driver after the party beats him. He was supposed to finish after just their first encounter, but he was beset by misfortune, as shown by the guardrail behind him collapsing the moment he leaned on it, plunging him into the Cloud Sea.</p>
                    
                <p>Once in Indol, the group discovers a gathering of Gormotti refugees demonstrating against the usage of blades. The Gormotti refugees probably think that Indol controls war itself because Zeke, who caught up to the party through unidentified means, discloses that Indol is in charge of distributing Core Crystals to other countries.</p>

                <p>After settling in, Rex asks Pyra to tell him more about Addam. Pyra responds that Rex reminds her a lot of Addam and that, despite the fact that she was just made just before her sleep, Mythra thinks of Addam as the most heroic person she has ever encountered. Rex and Nia discover Fan la Norne thinking about a mural that shows the creation of Alrest the following morning. Fan regrets that she has no recollection of the period, even though she is aware that she was there. Rex advises her to speak with Mythra about this. Brighid welcomes Pyra to her room and tells her that she keeps a diary and can therefore "recall" a lot of her past. Brighid notes that many Blades try to keep diaries because their memories are erased once each Driver dies, but these diaries are frequently lost between Drivers. Brighid is fortunate, though, because she was inherited as an imperial treasure. Then, because continued suppression would simply postpone the mental suffering and erode the bond between Blades and their Drivers that Mythra so vehemently underlined 500 years ago, she counsels the Aegis to reveal Rex her whole background. </p>
                    
                <p>Rex discloses the group's plan to travel to Elysium in order to assist in resolving disputes with the dying Titans when they meet with Praetor Amalthus, who turns out to be the one who scaled the World Tree and acquired the Aegis Core Crystals. Prior to climbing the World Tree, Amalthus says he thought like Rex. Though he struggles to identify what is happening, Rex starts to feel Malos during the conversation and notices Amalthus flicker between his appearance and Malos's. Rex agrees when Amalthus asks Pyra for a private conversation to reflect on the Aegis War.</p>
                    
                <p>Mythra challenges Amalthus during their chat since he would never have before permitted someone to enter Elysium. Amalthus says he wants to think that Rex can fulfill the destiny of someone reaching the Architect and saving their world.</p>
                    
                <p>Jin is fascinated by the Judicium weapon's resistance to time after arriving in Temperantia and sneaking into the Ardainian excavation site. After that, he turns on the weapon and destroys a large portion of the Urayan soldiers positioned on Temperantia.</p>
                    
                <p>When news of the "Ardainian" attack reaches Indol, Mòrag goes up against Senator Roderich, who is in charge of Mor Ardain's pro-war faction. The group assumes Tornan participation and travels to Temperantia to look into it after Roderich admits he did not approve the attack. Zeke joins the party, knowing that Torna is probably involved.</p>
                    
                <p>The Judicium Titan is raging toward the Urayan soldiers when the party arrives on Temperantia. Rex proposes attacking the Titan, but Mòrag cautions that the creature is highly flammable, as demonstrated by the explosion of one early in the excavation process. Fan la Norne attempts to hold the beast, but the group decides to climb it since cutting the ether cords is the only way to subdue it.</p>
                    
                <p>Jin confronts the group after turning off the beast's defense mechanism. Jin, who was a pacifist during the Aegis War, responds to Mythra's concern about why he would be focused on his present objectives by claiming that Mythra was his catalyst, sinking the Kingdom of Torna during the conflict and killing Lora. Jin then reveals that he is a Blade, although one with an unusual Core Crystal that resembles blood.</p>
                    
            <p>Even when Fan la Norne tries to weaken Jin, he is able to fight back, eventually "setting her free" by breaking Fan's crystal. Jin isolates himself to fortify himself as she passes away since her last movements remind him of Lora's passing. He then laments that Blade memories are ephemeral and that they are not able to be passed on like human memories. In essence, he says, these traits have enabled Blades to be enslaved by humans, which inspired him to become the person he is now. He claims that the guests would have understood his reasoning if they had witnessed the final state of humanity. He is going to attack the party when his crystal reacts and renders him helpless. When Akhos shows up, the beast's defense system is momentarily reactivated, allowing him and Jin to flee. After the fight, Rex regrets that he was unable to save Fan's life because, even though he is now a Driver of the Aegis, he is still as helpless and powerless as before. Regretfully for Rex and the others, the Titan weapon's devastation immediately led to hostility with Uraya, which is only resolved by the Indol Titan's arrival.</p>

                <h2>Chapter 6: Wounds</h2>
                <br>
                <div class="center2">
                <p>The chapter opens with a flashback that describes Jin and Lora's initial encounter. Ten-year-old Lora used a Core Crystal to resonate with it and call forth Jin. Despite Lora's mother's entreaties, a man who is angry with her for wasting a Crystal that took him three years to acquire is ready to kill her. Jin, who swears to defend Lora, knocks him down just before he can deliver the hit.</p>
                    
                <p>After being returned to the Tornan headquarters, Jin recuperates and is met by Malos. Jin responds that they might not be all that different from humans after all when Malos starts to reflect philosophically on how he and Jin appear to be losing their old personalities.</p>
                    
                <p>A ceasefire is declared in an attempt to defuse the situation, and Mythra and the rulers of both countries—Queen Raqura of Uraya and Emperor Niall of Ardain—as well as Zeke and Niranira, who stand in for Tantal and Argentum, respectively, are called upon to serve as neutral parties.</p>
                    
                <p>Raqura is first dubious of Niall's assertion that the attack was not approved by imperial order during the meeting with all of the country's rulers, and he is even more dubious of the notion that the Aegis Malos was involved. In the end, Zeke and Mythra, who are witnesses to the incident, persuade her. Then, according to Mythra, Malos is still recuperating from his injuries sustained during the Aegis War, but if he makes it to Elysium, he might fully heal and experience the same tragedies as five hundred years earlier. Then, with sadness, Amalthus affirms the myth that he was the one who awakened Malos and let him loose on the world. He barred the way to the World Tree to avoid a recurrence of the War, but now that Malos is back, it might be time to remove that limitation.</p>
                    
                <p>Since they are all in one location and it would save them a great deal of trouble later, Patroka and Mikhail outside discuss the possibilities of getting rid of the country's leadership. Akhos tells them, though, that Jin is not eager to wipe out humanity right away. Rather, they would simultaneously annihilate the Architect and humanity once the way to the World Tree is opened.</p>
                    
            <p>Mythra and Amalthus talk after the meeting. When Mythra asks Amalthus why he connected with Haze during their conversation, he responds that she was quite helpful in fending off Torna's attacks. When Amalthus suggests that it was just out of Jin's patriotism or nostalgia for the country, Mythra finds it odd that the group is adopting the name of a vanished state.</p>
                    
                <p>Rex, Mythra, Nia, and Dromarch attend the state funeral for Fan, who the Indoline considered a goddess. Fan is still in her Blade form and hasn't changed back to a Core Crystal, while Mythra and Nia observe. Mythra is even more confused because she is positive that Fan is not a flesh eater like Cole is. She adds that Fan's crystal has transformed from a diamond to a triangle, which is not the shape it was during the Aegis War. Her Crystal would not have transformed the way it does, even if she had been in Mythra/Pyra's shoes, having sacrificed a portion of their lives for Rex.</p>
                    
                <p>Amalthus appoints Rex as a special envoy to Tantal following the burial. Amalthus makes Rex think of Ophion, the serpent that stopped them from trying to climb the World Tree in the first place. Amalthus tells that the steps employed to thwart efforts to climb the World Tree included the formation of the Great Void around it and the revival of Ophion, one of the fabled Artifices that Mythra mentions had been destroyed during the Aegis War. Zeke claims that the sole weapon that can defeat the snake, the Omega Fetter, is protected by the royal family. Later on, Zeke reveals that the Tantalese are descended from Addam, who established the Kingdom of Tantal after sealing the Aegis. Only a small number of people are aware of the legend, which is only supported by the Tantalese royal symbol. Though they joke that Zeke's luck will bring them all down, the group departs for Tantal the following day.</p>
                    
                <p>Raqura and Niall intend to talk about further conditions pertaining to the Temperantia attack on board the Titan Battleship. Unfortunately, Niranira enters bearing news of Bana's assassination plot. In order to prevent public upheaval, Mòrag asks the other members of the party to deal with the conspiracy in a covert manner. After speaking with people in Indol, Rex concludes that Bana is planning to use Tirkins to contaminate the meeting's food. Unfortunately, Pupunin recruited the Tirkins, or famous Fire Dragons, for the event, thus the conclusion quickly proves to be false. Soon later, there is an explosion in the Titan Battleship's hangar.</p>
                    
                <p>As it happens, Bana upgraded the previous big Blade model to create Giga Rosa. He intends to murder Raqura in order to prolong the conflict between Uraya and Mor Ardain and benefit Argentum. Bana tries to destroys them all when Rex and his companions, Mòrag and Niall, show up. This backfires, though, since Giga Rosa is easily disposed of by the party.</p>
                    
                <p>Bana sets off explosives that have been planted in Giga Rosa as a last resort to carry out his scheme. Although Niall commands his Blade Aegaeon to defend everyone, it inadvertently travels too far to remain inside the barrier. Aegaeon switches back to his Core Crystal after the bombs explode, seriously wounding Niall. Before surreptitiously resurrecting Niall, Nia gives Dromarch instructions to divert everyone's attention. A colorful Core Crystal at the center of Nia's chest is revealed during this process.</p>
                    
                <p>After clearing it with Amalthus, Niall assigns Mòrag to protect the Aegis and the Driver on their journey to Tantal the following day. Mòrag is hesitant to leave Niall's side, but she agrees after her brother reminds her of her power and the importance of using it. Prior to Mòrag's departure, Niall gives her Aegaeon's Core Crystal since he felt that his prior carelessness demonstrated his ineptitude as a driver.</p>

                <p>Raqura assesses the Aegis's awakening status as they make their way back to Uraya. She believes this is why Niall put Mòrag with Rex, pointing out that the disaster of the Aegis War might happen again.</p>
                    
                <p>Soon after, the group departs for Tantal. Zeke is an exile from Tantal, as Pandoria tells on the journey. The monarch disowned Zeke at the age of 15 because he continued to travel outside of Tantal for pleasure despite the Kingdom of Tantal's extremely stringent border regulations. After that, Zeke went around Alrest, but Amalthus discovered him in terrible condition and took him to Indol. Given the Aegis' awakening and the necessity of ending Tantal's isolationist posture, Zeke says he hopes to be let to return to his native country.</p>
                    
                <p>When Zeke and Pandoria arrive, they disclose that Tantal is situated in Genbu, a Titan that is mostly buried beneath the Cloud Sea. Before alerting the group of Tantal's frigid climate, Pandoria calls the Titan to the surface.</p>
                
                <p>Eventually, the group reaches the royal Theoscaldia Palace and the capital city Theosoir. As they walk in, Mòrag starts to suspect something is wrong and asks Tora to help.</p>
                    
                <p>When King Eulogimenos destroys the letter that Praetor Amalthus sent, her suspicions are validated. After that, Eulogimenos captures Pyra and imprisons Rex, Nia, Tora, and Mòrag. Additionally, he renders all of the Blades inoperable by upsetting the ether around them. Before disclosing their family's history, Eulogimenos acknowledges to Zeke that he intends to destroy the Aegis for Alrest's benefit.</p>
                    
                <p>Mòrag admits in their prison cell that she had prepared for the event. Poppi can store ether in her furnace, but most Blades rely on the ether around them. After she and Tora assist Poppi in blasting out their cell, the group descends beneath the palace to save Pyra. Zeke rejoins the group along the road.</p>
        
                <p>When Rex and his pals finally locate Pyra, they learn that Eulogimenos intends to use an ether accelerator to kill her. After fighting through the guards, Poppi angles the accelerator to avoid Pyra, and Zeke frees her from her shackles after managing to delay the accelerator.</p>
                    
                <p>Then, according to Eulogimenos, Addam vanished when the Aegis War ended. The royal dynasty is not descended from Addam, even if Tantal was created from Torna's bones. Pyra explains that Addam truly decided not to return, despite Eulogimenos' suggestion that he died upon returning from sealing the Aegis. Next, she displays a holographic image of Addam that was made on the day she was sealed. When the Aegis awakens, Addam entrusts her to future generations, acknowledging that the seal on her is not permanent. Addam claims that his goal is basically a trial for humanity in a brief flashback to the day Pyra was sealed. The planet is not worthy of the Aegis unless Blades and humans can coexist peacefully.</p>
                    
                <p>Unfortunately, the Omega Fetter is struck by the ether accelerator blast, which prevents Pandoria from communicating with Genbu. After three hours, the Titan starts to plunge far into the Cloud Sea and runs the risk of collapsing, killing everyone in Tantal. Rex and his pals go to the device's location while Eulogimenos evacuates the Tantalese because Pyra/Mythra thinks she can fix the Omega Fetter, which was used to control Ophion during the Aegis War.</p>
                  
                <p>Mòrag becomes even more suspicious of Eulogimenos when the group departs Theosoir. Given how he angrily dismissed the communication from Indol, she believes the king is concealing additional secrets. She believes Tantal and Indol harbor a deep-seated animosity, but Dromarch speculates that it might have something to do with Torna battling under the name of the former kingdom. With reference to the histories, Rex further suggests a link to Jin's statement regarding the final state of humanity, which makes Pyra question whether or not she ought to have been imprisoned.</p>
                    
                <p>The group soon stumbles into an Aegis War battleground next to Genbu's head, where the Omega Fetter is kept. Pyra then describes how, during the Aegis War, both Mythra and Malos employed Artifices, strong weapons created for the Aegises. The beams that returned the Tornan Blades to their Core Crystals came from Siren, which Mythra used in conjunction with Ophion. Every Artifice is linked to an Elysium-stored weapon. Pyra then acknowledges that she doesn't know anything about Elysium and that the only thing she remembers about it is the townscape where she first saw Rex.</p>
                    
                <p>The group eventually locates the Omega Fetter, which Mythra fixes. However, Akhos, Mikhail, and Patroka approach them as they go, revealing themselves to be Flesh Eaters similar to Cole. The three are defeated by the group, but Jin and Malos get there before Zeke can render them unconscious. Jin then shows his actual form, which allows him to move at the speed of light and control the elements. He defeats the majority of the group, negates Mythra's Foresight, and even stops Siren's beam strike.</p>
                    
                <p>Jin then defeats Rex, knocking him and Mythra down and destroying Mythra's sword altogether. Artificial blades are then used to pin the group down. But Pyra steps in just as Jin is ready to murder Rex and take the Core Crystal out of his chest. She is able to command Siren to direct its targeting laser toward her. She threatens to turn up the targeting laser's strength and obliterate Jin with particles traveling at the speed of light if he doesn't save Rex and the others. Jin gives in with the stipulation that Pyra clear the path to Elysium for Torna, since they require the Aegis to survive for their schemes. Jin seizes Pyra as she collapses after taking the Omega Fetter. He chastises Rex for disregarding his own Blade's welfare. Then, as Rex cries in despair, Torna departs with Pyra before passing out off-screen.</p>

                <h2>Chapter 7: The Fear She Carries</h2>
                <br>
                <div class="center2">
                <p>Before the entrance to the adjacent chamber opens, the chapter begins with flashing images of a pitch-black area.</p>
                    
            <p>News of the events in Tantal reaches Amalthus. He gives the go-ahead for a ceremony. An emerald glow rises from Indol's lowlands.</p>
                    
                    
                <p>Rex, who was rescued at Anastatia's two days after Pyra was kidnapped, is distraught by his total defeat at Jin's hands and leaves the party, thinking he would never be able to overcome someone of Jin's level. Since he is disregarding the amount of suffering Pyra endured in order to assist Rex, his announcement angers the group, especially Nia and Brighid, who chastise him for the choice. Brighid specifically mentions Pyra's discussion with Corinne, in which the former questioned whether it would be better for her to remain apart from Rex for his sake. Poppi also snaps, claiming that she didn't recognize this Rex. Eulogimenos interrupts the diatribe with a summons for Rex.</p>
                    
                <p>Tantal's entire history in relation to their Tornan heritage is revealed by Eulogimenos. There was an internal conflict in Torna following the Aegis War. Some adhered to Addam's theory that Titans, Blades, and humans should live side by side as equals. Others, however, wanted the Blades and Titans to be enslaved by humans, who would act as their masters. Amidst the confusion, a faction of Tornans on the opposing side of Addam exploited Addam's departure. They claimed to be of Addam's ancestry, acquired the Omega Fetter, and brought the country together behind counter-Addam principles. In order to conceal their secret, the party sent Genbu deep into the Cloud Sea after establishing themselves as the first members of the Tantalese royal line.</p>
                    
                <p>Unfortunately, Tantal's secret was discovered by Indol, who then used it as a kind of blackmail. Tantal had to ship Core Chips to Indol on a regular basis to keep their secret safe. Since every country's military depends on Core Chips, this would enable Indol to increase their power. However, Tantal became penniless due to the harsh weather, failing crops, and extended submersion in the Cloud Sea. Amalthus demanded that Tantal turn over the Omega Fetter in the letter that Rex brought from Indol, failing which Indol will divulge their secret. Eulogimenos attempted to eradicate Pyra/Mythra out of fear that Indol might utilize the Omega Fetter and Aegis against Tantal.</p>
                    
                    
                <p>Then, by pointing out how strange it is that Jin, a regular Blade, was able to defeat Mythra, the legendary Aegis, Eulogimenos offers a potential way ahead. Eulogimenos offers one of Tantal's history, which talks about a third sword, even though Rex has used two Aegis Swords—one for Pyra and one for Mythra. It is said that the Aegis's real sword is this third one. During the Aegis War, Addam was unable to use the power and sealed it away with the Aegis. Eulogimenos recommends starting the quest at the Leftherian Archipelago, which is the final location in the history. Additionally, he trusts Zeke to protect Rex since he believes the latter can unleash the might of the Aegis.</p>
                    
                <p>Malos and Akhos sit in their headquarters, thinking about the unconscious Pyra. Given that Pyra and Rex share a life force, Akhos questions why Pyra would have given herself up. However, Malos adds that since the Aegis can exist for a short time without a Core Crystal, she probably would have given Rex the remaining portion of her life force, enabling him to live even after she was destroyed.</p>
                    
                <p>Azurda discloses at Fonsett that Addam assigned him the duty of protecting the third Aegis Sword against intruders. He also reveals Hero's Rest, another name for Fonsett. He leads the group to the Village Guardian's shrine, where Rex discovers a seal that only a Leftherian can crack. He discovers that this is why Torna need a Leftherian when they initially looked for the Aegis. A passageway to the Spirit Crucible Elpys is revealed when the shrine is buried in the earth. Azurda also reveals that many people have gone into the Spirit Crucible since the sword rumors started, but nobody has come back.</p>
                    
                <p>Malos confronts Pyra at a place close to the Great Void, saying he wants retribution for the Aegis War. He displays his broken Aegis crystal, which he intends to repair by stealing Pyra's.</p>
                    
                <p>The Blades start to notice strange things in the surroundings as the group descends into Elpys. Their concerns are confirmed by Azurda, who says that particles in the cave's air have the ability to absorb Blades' energy. The Blades, especially Pandoria, are adamant about remaining with the group, nevertheless.</p>

                <p>Unexpectedly, Zeke starts to suffer as the ether-absorbing particles soon take their toll. Zeke then describes how he got acquainted with Indol and shows off a Core Crystal in his left chest. Zeke suffered potentially fatal wounds from combat after escaping Tantal. He wished Pandoria luck with her next driver and expressed regret for his incapacity as a driver. Unwilling to return to her Crystal and forget their ten years of being together, Pandoria attempts to carry Zeke to safety but also passes out. Zeke describes himself as a "Blade Eater" after Amalthus, who fortunately finds the two just before Pandoria passes out, takes a piece of Pandoria's Core Crystal and implants it into him.</p>
                    
                <p>Soon after, Nia starts to feel tired as well, so Mòrag advises Rex that they take some time to relax. To aid with Nia's recovery, Rex provides her an air tank. Throughout the rest of the journey, Nia shares her past. She was raised alongside her father and sister in a wealthy Gormotti household. Unfortunately, her sister developed serious health issues, which caused their father to frantically look for a remedy, ultimately costing them their upper-class status. During the family's wanderings, Nia's sister passed away and never fully recovered.</p>
                    
                <p>Shortly after the death of her sister, Nia also lost her father. Nia finds her father's Core Crystal after grieving, and she is able to awaken Dromarch from it. Regretfully, Indol soon began pursuing the two and eventually captured them. After Jin took care of her and allowed her to join Torna, she was eventually released from prison.</p>
                    
                <p>When the group finally arrives in the center of Elpys, they discover yet another of Addam's seals. But soon after, the Phantasms—dark apparitions of Addam acting as the final guardians of the sword—attack them. The group makes an effort to repel the never-ending waves of Phantasms, but they are ultimately overpowered, and Rex almost suffers a fatal wound. Distressed by the losses she has experienced (her sister, Vandham, Fan la Norne, etc.), Nia confesses her actual identity as a Flesh Eater and won't allow the group to experience another setback. The party is able to expel all of the Phantasms by using Nia's powers. Rex returns to the townscape where he first encountered Pyra, this time with Addam by the tree, just before they vanish. Addam believes Rex deserves the third Aegis Sword and praises him for his resolve and selflessness. The sword is on a pedestal when Rex returns to Elpys. He has two visions while wielding the sword: the first shows the world being destroyed, and the second shows the enigmatic room from the start of the chapter. To the party's displeasure, the blade vanishes as soon as these visions are over. Unfazed, however, Rex declares he is prepared to save Pyra/Mythra.</p>
                    
                <p>Rex uses his visions to determine Pyra's location back in Fonsett: a Titan close to the Great Void. After Mòrag and Dromarch determine that the Titan is the Cliffs of Morytha, Mòrag successfully arranges for an Ardainian royal ship to transport them there.</p>
                    
                <p>Despite Pyra's pleading, Malos starts stealing her memories of Rex while he is repairing his crystal. Malos eventually succeeds in fully repairing his crystal and takes possession of the Omega Fetter. It turns out that Ophion has an automated defensive mechanism, which almost destroys Jin and Malos.</p>
                    
                <p>Rex and his comrades encounter Malos at the Cliffs of Morytha; Malos has finished his Core Crystal and is brandishing a weapon like a Monado. Rex notes that his life energy is entwined with Pyra's and that he is still alive, despite Malos revealing that Pyra has probably died during the healing process. The party just escapes Malos's attempt to bomb them. Malos uses his power to kill anything that enters his dark sphere of influence when Zeke tries to attack him. But Nia uses her power to repair everything Malos destroys, no longer concealing the fact that she is a Flesh Eater. </p>
                    
                <p>Rex finds Jin and an unconscious Pyra after continuing up the Titan. Malos, who survived their last encounter, also shows up. Rex sees how stupid he has been after attempting in vain to wake Pyra. Even though he and the Aegis were not destined to be together, he had made a valiant effort to follow their path. He nevertheless made the decision to bring Pyra and Mythra to Elysium, and in the process, he surprised Jin by discovering what it means to be Driver and Blade.</p>
                    
                <p>Malos and Jin cool the battlefield to almost nothing after growing tired of Nia's healing abilities. The pair easily overwhelms the group with Nia disabled as a Blade, while Rex is able to compete with Jin. Pyra and Mythra use their remaining abilities to speak to Rex as he is fighting. In an attempt to convince him to give up on them, Pyra acknowledges that he traveled to Elysium in order to request that the Architect put an end to them and release Alrest from the miseries they had caused. Rex reminds them of his pledge to go with them to Elysium, which he plans to uphold at all costs, and he is still adamant about getting there.</p>
                    
                <p>Rex abruptly finds himself in a chamber with a huge mech, and Pyra and Mythra are standing in front of it. Rex gets the third Aegis Sword, an emerald saber composed almost completely of light, and assists them in waking up. Additionally, Pyra/Mythra awakens their actual form, Pneuma, who has emerald hair and chrome armor adorned with emerald lights. Before they take on Jin and Malos once more, Rex also receives a suit of armor with a similar design.</p>
                    
                <p>Rex quickly outpaces Jin by matching his speed in Pyra/Mythra's real form. But just as they are about to win, Rex sees that Jin is upset and gives in, even though Jin had warned him of the problems that would arise otherwise. Malos then discloses Torna's entire scheme, which calls for destroying the Architect, the world, and humanity. Malos asserts that his ultimate destiny is to become the Endbringer, the destruction of everything, and trigger Aion, the strongest Artifice. Then he calls Ophion to assault the gathering. The conflict between the two Artifices destroys the platform, sending the group into the Great Void, despite Pyra/Mythra calling upon Siren to protect against Ophion.</p>

                <h2>Chapter 8: World Tree</h2>
                <br>
                <div class="center2">
                <p>Pyra and Mythra are under the tree close to Elysium at the beginning of the chapter. There's still a ringing sound, but the Elysium church bells have silenced. The decision to go back to Rex is made by Pyra and Mythra.</p>
                    
            <p>When Mythra and Rex awaken, they discover themselves in the Land of Morytha, a destroyed city adjacent to the World Tree's roots, beneath the Cloud Sea. Rex updates Mythra on all that has transpired since Torna kidnapped her as they look for a way out. Mythra responds that their third form is both of them at the same time when Rex inquires about it.</p>
                    
        <p>After a while, Rex and Mythra encounter Jin, who is protecting himself from a Guldo. Rex knocks the Guldo out after Jin sustains severe injuries, but the Guldo gets back up. Fortunately, Poppi, Azurda, and Brighid show up, and Brighid destroys the Guldo by burning it.</p>
                    
    <p>Rex convinces Mythra to heal Jin when he passes out during the fight. Brighid learns from Mythra that she can process data from any Blade because she is the Aegis. She discovers that Jin is a Flesh Eater throughout the healing process because he has a human heart. Jin never went back to his Core Crystal, thus when he gets better, he remembers Mythra's name. Mythra confronts Jin about why he now supports their former adversary when Rex reminds her that they fought together against Malos. She concludes that Lora resides inside Jin, despite his insistence that knowing the answer would destroy Mythra. Jin is cautioned by Rex not to obstruct their path as they intend to arrive in Elysium. Jin then discloses that, according to Malos, the Architect was born in Morytha.</p>
    
                    <p>When Brighid questions Jin about her past and whether her journal tells the truth about who she is, Jin responds that she is not at all like the Brighid of 500 years ago. He remembers the day Lora was formally proclaimed a Tornan Driver after being pressed by Brighid and Poppi about the previous Brighid.</p>
                    
                <p>Later, Poppi and Mythra reflect on the civilization that once inhabited Morytha as everyone else is asleep. Humans from all eons are identical, according to Mythra, and even though the Morytha civilization made significant technological advances, their arrogance ultimately brought about their own demise. Poppi, an artificial Blade and a technological marvel, is alarmed by this comment and fears that she might assault the planet in the future. Mythra is asked by Poppi to swear to destroy her if that threat materializes. Mythra accepts, but requests a favor from Poppi. Poppi grants Mythra's request, but she requests some time to think it over.</p>
                    
                    <p>Rex and Mythra start to question who the Architect is and how great their society must have been when the group battles their way through more Guldos. Jin laughs, pointing out that human hubris is a natural tendency that will ultimately lead to the extinction of the species. Jin starts to answer when Rex questions him about his dislike of people, but he is interrupted by the distant Tornan Titan.</p>
                    
                <p>Below the Cloud Sea, Akhos, Patroka, Mikhail, and Akhos can be seen attempting to steer the Monoceros. Even though the ship's pressure starts to get close to critical, it nevertheless makes it to the Land of Morytha.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Tornan Titan's matrix, or womb, is where Rex and Jin end up. Jin and Mythra disclose the Blade's whole life cycle there. Titans cultivate Core Crystals, which give birth to blades. Blades are not immortal; rather, they eventually return to their parents and transform into Titans, but they lose all recollection of their previous life as Blades. This life cycle was revered by the Tornans in antiquity, but with the Aegis War and Mythra's subsequent departure, the equilibrium was disrupted.</p>
                    
                    
                <p>Jin goes on to disclose that, in spite of his first charges against Mythra, Indol—who was ruled by Amalthus—was the one who destroyed Torna. It is also revealed that Lora died as a result of the Indoline attack on Torna. Lora sustains life-threatening injuries after protecting Jin from a bomb. For her type, being forgotten is worse than dying, Lora says as she passes away. Jin doesn't want to forget his time with Lora, even though she wishes him luck with his next driver. He kills the Indoline that is after them after consuming Lora and turning into a Flesh Eater to keep his memory of her alive.</p>
                    
            <p>Pyra interprets this tale as evidence that she shouldn't have vanished from Alrest. Jin explains that despite his dread of the Aegis' power, Amalthus would not have changed his behavior if she had not vanished because of his character and his desire to utilize the Architect's power to wipe out everything. Rex notes that Jin's analysis is hypocritical in light of Torna's objectives, but he thinks Jin has a different motivation in the end. Jin disputes Rex's assertion, saying he is sick of people using Blades as tools. Another Guldo interrupts their discourse, which Jin interprets as evidence of human hubris.</p>
                    
                  <p>After that, Rex is joined by Mòrag, Nia, Tora, and Zeke, who help vanquish the Guldo. To his surprise, Rex discovers a human ID card on the Guldo after it has been vanquished.</p>

                        <p>The party in camp is worried about allying with Jin. They all agree in the end, but Mòrag cautions that once their agony is finished, she will start to take Jin into Ardainian prison. But they are cut short when the Monoceros and Torna show up with the intention of ruining the celebration. When Patroka tries to defy Jin's instructions, he interrupts the ship and instructs them not to fire. The party then rushes up the World Tree when Jin leaves them and boards the ship. However, he informs Brighid that she is the Blade from 500 years ago before departing.</p>
                    
                    <p>Niall is informed in Hardhaigh Palace about new initiatives to increase Mor Ardain's chances of survival. Since Dughall was only recently recalled and the emperor does not want to cause any unrest, Niall rejects the suggestion of some of his subjects to move the capital to Gormott.</p>
                    
                    <p>When Rex and the group get at the World Tree's roots, they discover that the Great Void has vanished since Ophion was freed from its job. When Pyra/Mythra's real form calls forth an elevator, the group learns that the World Tree is a technological structure when Pyra guides them within. Pyra acknowledges that she wasn't sure how she knew to call the elevator because her body seemed to move just instinctively.</p>
    
                    <p>Jin realizes that his activities would have undoubtedly garnered Lora's condemnation after he heals from his injuries on the Monoceros, but he continues because he made a vow. Jin also tells Malos about the Tornan Titan he found. He then recalls how Addam had hoped Blades would coexist with people, but now he understands that they have been living for people. With Lora's body hanging on the Monoceros as a reminder of such absurd ideas, he mocks his former self for believing in the Architect.</p>
                    
                    <p>Rex starts thinking about what Jin told him about Amalthus' past as he and his buddies climb the World Tree. Amalthus would understand that destroying Torna would also destroy the Blades within it, as he appears to despise both humans and Blades. Rex argues that it would make sense for Amalthus to want to wipe off the planet given the level of hatred he feels. Rex goes on to compare Amalthus and Malos, stating that speaking with Amalthus for the first time was similar to speaking with Malos and that their objectives would be similar.</p>
                    
                    <p>Amalthus remembers his early years in Indol. A group of men were chasing him and his mother. Before rerouting the guys, his mother rescued him by concealing him in a ditch. Amalthus emerged to discover his mother's body and the men dozing out in their camp. Before stoning her murderers, Amalthus laid his mother's body to rest.</p>
                    
                    <p>As it happens, the Indoline Titan is traveling across the Cloud Sea. Torna learns that Indol has reached the World Tree while aboard the Marsanes (Monoceros). The Indoline militia and massive ether lasers are then used by Indol to attack the Marsanes. Akhos turns on the Blade Bots and the guns in an attempt to launch a counterattack. Mikhail and Jin go over Torna's plan: the Marsanes can only transport Jin and Malos to the exterior of the Tree; once there, they will disembark and enter the Tree alone.</p>
                    
                    <p>The group eventually discovers the Indol and Marsanes engaged in combat. Mòrag understands that the attack on the battleship was the result of Indol anticipating Torna's effort to climb the World Tree.</p>
                                        
                <p>Amalthus discovers Rex on the World Tree in the present. To command Rex and Mythra to defeat the Marsanes, he dispatches his subjects. Amalthus confronts the group and chastises them for their disobedience after Rex declines, defeating Amalthus' subjects in the process. After consuming half of Fan la Norne's Crystal, he also reveals that he is a Blade Eater. Amalthus also identifies the green vortex whirling over Indol and explains its function: Amalthus may use the vortex to defeat any Blade, including Mythra, by combining his might as the Driver of an Aegis with Fan's power. He calls forth the Siren from Mythra, but Mythra fights back hard enough that the blast grazes the Marsanes rather than striking them directly.</p>
                    
                <p>Jin and Malos leave when the Marsanes make it to the World Tree. Since Amalthus cannot control Akhos, Patroka, and Mikhail since they are Flesh Eaters, they are entrusted with protecting the ship.</p>
                    
                <p>Amalthus lashes out at the group for their persistent disobedience and attempts to call Siren to attack the Marsanes once more. When Mythra objects, saying that Rex is her Driver, Azurda understands that Rex may equal Amalthus in skill because he is a Master Driver. Rex uses this knowledge to release his party's Blades from Amalthus's influence and conjure a powerful beam that turns out to be emanating from a massive structure like an Aegis Core Crystal. Furthermore, one of the pillars supporting the vortex is effectively destroyed by Torna's Blade Bots. Amalthus may still employ his ultimate power, which is the capacity to control the Titans, despite being weaker in the area of his power. He calls forth Mor Ardain, who then attacks the World Tree with a strong beam strike.</p>

                <h2>Chapter 9: Rain</h2>
                <br>
                <div class="center2">
                <p>A youthful Amalthus used to wander around Alrest, sharing his lessons and tending to the injured. He passes a home with a weeping child while traveling. He enters and discovers a bandit who has already investigated the house and is ready to murder the child. He steps in and identifies the bandit as one of the injured people he has cared for. After killing the bandit, Amalthus cares for the baby. He looks in the direction of the World Tree as he walks away.</p>
                    
                <p>Rex's crew narrowly escapes the blast from Mor Ardain, and to Mòrag's surprise, they identify its source. Niall learns that the Titan has reached the World Tree on Mor Ardain. Given how near death Mor Ardain is, Niall and Azurda both understand that any additional ether blasts would render the Titan incapable of supporting itself and cause it to collapse under its own weight. After the Titan opens fire on the Marsanes, Uraya shows up on the scene. Fearing the worst, Mikhail gives the order for Patroka and Akhos to disembark and go with Jin and Malos, while he himself would be in charge of the Marsanes. To Patroka's ire, Mikhail declares his love for her as they depart.</p>
                    
                <p>After that, Mikhail turns the Marsanes into a little mechanical Titan and attacks Indol head-on. Seeing an opening, Zeke instructs Rex to go pursue Jin. Mòrag assures Rex that she has faith in her brother's talents as the Emperor of Mor Ardain, but she also urges him to concentrate on what the Titans are capable of.</p>
                    
                <p>Mor Ardain attacks the Marsanes once more. Niall orders Alba Cavanich to evacuate when Mikhail shoots Mor Ardain with an ether beam in revenge. He sends his wishes to Mòrag to save the world after allowing the use of all ships, including his personal ships.</p>
                    
                <p>Amalthus is in awe of the Torna organization's ability to revive old Tornan technology in Indol. Amalthus attempts to manipulate Mikhail by assuming that he is a Flesh Eater. Mikhail, however, discloses that he is a Blade Eater rather than a Flesh Eater. Mikhail reminds the Praetor of their history, despite Amalthus's insistence that such technology is not available outside of Indol. Amalthus used the technology to cure Torna refugees during the Aegis War, including a young Mikhail, prior to implanting Fan la Norne's crystal. Mikhail survived and escaped the genocide despite Amalthus's later attempts to expel the refugees. Mikhail observes the escaping Gormotti refugees as the Marsanes physically assault Indol, recognizing that Amalthus had not changed since the Aegis War and that there had been no attempt to evacuate the refugees before the onslaught. </p>
                    
                <p>Amalthus also summons Genbu when Mikhail smashes Indol into the World Tree. Amalthus is irritated at not being able to use the Aegises, Mòrag concludes. Rex understands that Amalthus is using the vortex to exert his power, and that they may lessen it by demolishing the pillars. Pyra proposes that they approach the Titan, where Rex may utilize Pyra/Mythra's third form to slow down time sufficiently for Mythra to target the pillars, even though Indol and the Marsanes are moving too much for Mythra to get a clear shot.</p>
                    
                <p>Poppi flies towards Rex and Mythra in the direction of Indol after the group makes it to a dock that protrudes from the World Tree. When Amalthus discovers their plan, he gives Indol the command to stop them from getting close to the vortex. Even though they discover that Indol is shielded by a barrier, they manage to demolish the pillars and release the Titans from Amalthus' rule. A beam from Indol is fired at the party by an enraged Amalthus, but Mikhail saves them. Mikhail instructs them to go after Jin and Malos as soon as they can. After Amalthus' purge, Mikhail hated people, but Rex and his group remind him of old Torna, where he was with the people he loved. Rex is asked by Mikhail if he has discovered the solution. Mikhail instructs Rex to locate Jin and share that response after he confirms. </p>
                    
                <p>Mikhail describes how he first met Jin while Indol gets ready for the last assault on the Marsanes. He was taken into the Addam's camp by Lora and Jin after they discovered him as the only person still alive after a raid on his town. Before the Marsanes are destroyed in a huge explosion, Mikhail apologizes to Jin for having to leave Alrest early, as his death and Lora's eventual devastation draw near.</p>
                  
                <p>Zeke describes the talks he had with Amalthus soon after he turned into a Blade Eater. Zeke is asked by Amalthus what he finds appealing about the refugees. Zeke claims that, similar to the other Titans, he witnesses individuals having difficulties. But since killing is solely for the weak-minded, he doesn't see the point in killing the migrants. Amalthus shows his distaste for the world as he wonders that this idea would make him the weakest of all of them.</p>
                    
                <p>After that, Zeke asks Rex what he thinks of the world. Rex reaffirms his love for the world as it is, despite the fact that some things are not as fantastic as they could be. Life is about accepting both the good and the terrible.</p>

                <p>As they get closer to the summit of the World Tree, Jin instructs Malos to climb the tree alone. Jin sees a vision of Lora and chooses to wait for Rex to arrive, despite Malos reminding him that they agreed to accomplish their goal together. Malos bids farewell before climbing to the summit of the World Tree.</p>
                    
                <p>Previously, an elderly man identified Jin as a Blade to a member of the Territorial Defence Corps coalition named Ornelia. After thanking Jin for saving his village, the elderly man discloses that Ornelia's home is still on the outskirts of the city. When Jin and Lora get to the house, Jin discovers his diary and a photo of him with Ornelia and her gang. In it, he learns that Ornelia died shortly after the end of the Aegis struggle and that the alliance was engaged in an independence struggle ninety years before. He also reads about how he became a Flesh Eater and of his former self's quest to discover who he really is. Jin tells Lora that he has no recollection of his history because he is shocked by the thought.</p>
                    
                <p>Jin tells Rex that he wanted to see if the world will pick Malos or Rex when he gets there. Jin would still be too weak from their trip through Morytha, so Mythra convinces Jin to let them pass. Jin confirms Mythra's concerns, but he also reminds her of his pledge to Malos to do whatever it takes to secure Torna's objective. After that, Jin changes into his actual form and fights Rex.</p>
                    
                <p>Jin wonders about Rex's motivations while they fight because it appears like opening Elysium will only destroy it. Jin asserts that, similar to what happened to Torna following the Aegis War, humans would eventually turn Elysium into another Morytha. Jin believes the conclusion is inevitable, despite Rex's ability to stop it from occurring during his lifetime. Rex, however, believes that the Blades' presence is a means of stopping this from occurring. Similar to how Blades are passed down from Driver to Driver until they become the Titans that support human existence and the development of new Blades, humans die but their memories live on. Although he thinks he already knows the answer, Rex acknowledges that he is jealous of Blades like Jin, Pyra, and Mythra and would like to ask the Architect why they exist.</p>
                    
                <p>Akhos and Patroka show up as Jin is suffering from the combat. Despite Patroka's attempts to defend Jin, he tells her to back off because they have exhausted all other options. Nia agrees when Patroka asks her to assist in Jin's recovery. As Patroka proceeds to get Jin ready for the treatment, she instructs Akhos to keep an eye on Jin. Unfortunately, a brilliant blue tendril stabs her, killing her. It is revealed that the tendril is a component of Amalthus, a monster creature with glowing blue tendrils and orbs that has absorbed Core Crystals. With all the information included in each Blade, he claims that the Architect made them for Amalthus to raise after absorbing Patroka's Crystal. According to Amalthus, this is the cause of the purification processes that resulted in this combat form. Amalthus asserts that he is an agent of the Architect's will as well. Despite the party's accusations of megalomania, Amalthus maintains that the Aegis is responsible for destroying the earth. Pyra/Mythra discovers that Amalthus, whose ideals corrupted Malos, is the direct cause of Malos's plans to wipe out the planet. Amalthus used the circumstances in Morytha as evidence for his indifference, stating that humanity never changes. Rex, on the other hand, disputes this notion, claiming that Amalthus is unchangeable and actively hostile to anyone who attempts to do so, as evidenced by the attack he launched on Torna following the Aegis War. Since altering would mean losing everything, including his identity, Amalthus accepts the challenge. Zeke adds that the Praetor is the weakest of them all, citing Amalthus's view as evidence of his frailty.</p>
                    
                <p>Akhos remembers their first encounter with Jin while lamenting Patroka's passing. Since Patroka and Akhos were Blades to two Tantalese siblings, Akhos considered Patroka to be his sister, particularly after they both turned into Flesh Eaters by their respective Drivers. Jin saved them before they were taken by Indoline soldiers, who later discovered and took them. When Jin asked if it was wise to hold onto the past, Akhos said that it was better than nothing because it gave him a reason to live for Patroka. Jin offers to take them into Torna after pointing out how much he resembles them.</p>
                    
                <p>Akhos rushes Amalthus in sadness and rage for Patroka's death, but is quickly defeated when one of the tendrils tightens around him. Amalthus chastises Rex and the group for attacking him, questioning why anybody would ever support Blades. As he tears out Akhos's Core Crystal and sends the latter into a torturous death, he chuckles at Zeke's response regarding the kinship between humans and Blades. Jin is furious over Akhos's passing and gets ready to attack Amalthus, but Rex warns him not to do so because Amalthus should still remain open to human assaults. Before the party fights Amalthus, Rex tells Jin to take care of his human side in response to his Flesh Eater state.</p>
                    
                <p>Even though it appears that Rex is winning, Amalthus won't go away until he has met the Architect and defeated Alrest. After that, he attaches himself to the World Tree itself and launches more assaults. His initial goal is to remove Jin's core as well, but Rex and Mythra stop him. Jin instructs Nia to care for the two when Rex sustains serious injuries. Jin responds that he understood that Nia would become the Blade of someone she trusted, comparing it to his time with Lora, when Nia asks him why he allowed her to join Rex and did not murder her. Before killing Amalthus by impaling him with a hail of ice spears, Jin orders Rex to halt Malos, who is still trying to figure out who he is.</p>
                
                <p>Amalthus, who is still suffering from his megalomania, begs the Architect to forgive him as he passes away. Zeke narrates another exchange with Amalthus in which the latter compares Pandoria's attempt to save Zeke to his own mother. Zeke questions how someone who harbors such hatred could appear so depressed in a single instance. Amalthus experiences a brilliant apparition of his mother in his last moments. Jin, who has used up all of his energy, collapses as well before vanishing in a golden light. Azurda praises Jin for his experiences as the light fades.</p>
                    
                <p>Malos encounters a veiled and forlorn Jin in an alley during a thunderstorm centuries ago. Before lending a helping hand, he acknowledges that Jin has lost his driver and shares the experience. After giving Malos a thoughtful glance, Jin tentatively extends his hand.</p>

                <h2>Final Chapter: And thus, boy met girl</h2>
                <br>
                <div class="center2">
                <p>Outside attackers known as the Saviorites launch a brutal attack on the space station, which it must resist. Despite their heroic efforts, Rhadamanthus loses a lot of soldiers, especially in their Echelon Siren mech arsenal. The station's director orders the Conduit to be prepared and permits the Saviorites to deploy their greatest weapon, Aion, just as they are ready to secure the space elevator. However, a professor on board named Klaus locks the station out of the Conduit.</p>
                    
                <p>In order to prepare his experiment to create a new universe, Klaus starts synchronizing the Conduit to the station's computer. Klaus is unmoved by Galea, his coworker, who tries to stop him. He refers to the Conduit as a gift from a divine being and a portal to other planets. Given how the Saviorites have destroyed their planet and the sky surrounding the station, he considers humans idiots and asserts that the only way to end the conflict is to create a new world. Klaus continues his experiment, and before the building and the planet explode, a beam of light envelops and circles the Earth.</p>
                    
                <p>The group finds themselves at a space station at the summit of the World Tree, where they can enjoy a breathtaking view of the Cloud Sea and the sky. The bells from Pyra's recollection of Elysium suddenly ring out to Rex, and they set out to locate the source.</p>
                    
                <p>Malos discovers the Architect, a sage elderly man who calls him Logos, in a large, dim room. The Architect discloses that Torna's goals and everything Malos went through had been transmitted to him. The Architect also indicates that he is fading and that there is no need to hasten the inevitable, despite Malos' attempt to kill him. When Malos asks if he really took the decision to end the world, the Architect answers that he did it in concert with someone else. The Architect notices the other Aegis arrive as Malos departs.</p>
               
                <p>The dead remains of the paradise meet Rex and Pyra as they reach the hill in Pyra's recollections. The whole region is empty and desolate, with no vegetation and all the houses in ruins, in contrast to the verdant meadows and bubbling water of Pyra's recollections. The group observes the parallels between Morytha and the desert environment as they enter the city, including the signs of past human habitation. Since there is enough space to accommodate everyone in Alrest, Mòrag observes how large the area is.</p>
                    
                <p>The bells were ringing when the group finally arrived at the chapel. The Architect greets them as they enter and makes a way beneath the altar. But when they come down, Rex finds that everyone is gone. In an attempt to find them, he finds himself in what seem to be different places he visited during his travels. He initially discovers the ancient Ardainian army sprinting past him and innumerable skulls all around his body. He flees in terror and ends up in Torigoth, where Nia and Dromarch approach him and are mad at Rex for deceiving them about Elysium. Angry that he took them on such a long journey while the Ardainians suffered from the conflict with Uraya and the coming of Mor Ardain's death, Rex then encounters Mòrag and Brighid at Alba Cavanich after the battle. On the Cliffs of Morytha, Rex then encounters Tora, Poppi, Zeke, and Pandoria, all of whom are envious of Rex's position as a Master Driver.</p>
           
                <p>Rex is able to pin Tora and Zeke under debris during his fight with them, but while attempting to save them, he is taken to adult Azurda, where he once more sees the Titan's death from before he met Pyra. As Blades are created, live innumerable lives, transform into Titans, and then wander the globe interminably till their death, Azurda starts to think nihilistically about the meaning of things. Rex and other humans have limitations, though, and Azurda wonders how he would feel if he were him. Rex is troubled by the comments and finds it difficult to reply.</p>
                    
                <p>After that, Rex ends up in Fonsett, where Pyra and Mythra greet him with joy. But he feels that the personalities of Mythra and Pyra are nearly completely different. Rex eventually breaks down in uncertainty as a result of the abrupt shift in everyone's mindsets. Realizing the emotional harm Rex is going through, Pyra and Mythra beg the Architect to adjourn the trial.</p>
                    
                <p>When Rex unexpectedly finds himself back with his group, he discovers that everyone had similar experiences. Before introducing himself to the gathering, the architect declares that he was trying to test their hearts. In addition, he presents himself as Klaus, the same individual who wiped out the old world. Klaus acknowledges that he wanted to observe how humanity had evolved and recognizes their struggles as different routes their life could have taken, along with the worries they secretly carried. Then he tells Alrest's backstory.</p>
                    
                  
                <p>Klaus begins by explaining his previous universe and how human nature was to have desires. Klaus was no exception, but he also lost faith in the species. He discovered that the Conduit was a portal to other universes, most of which are generally ignorant of one another. In an attempt to alter his own universe, Klaus turned on the Conduit, which opened gateways to other ones. Only what would become Morytha and the right half of Klaus's body remained after the majority of the planet and civilization were taken to other universes. In another version, his left half continues to live, but Klaus could sense that his death was drawing near in that world. He attributes everything to his previous stupidity and characterizes his current situation as punishment, depriving him of the solution he was looking for as well as the state of forgetfulness he could experience.</p>
                    
                <p> Klaus became resolved to rebuild his former home as a kind of atonement. He first produced particles that gathered into the Cloud Sea and had the ability to both dismantle and restore matter. Klaus then regenerated life in the form of Core Crystals, which stored information of earlier lifeforms, after the Cloud Sea destroyed the previous civilization. Titans were created when the Core Crystals formed a relationship with the Cloud Sea, and later, evolution would produce new human species. But Klaus also understood that history might repeat itself, creating a new generation of people who would ruin the planet in their own pursuits. He invented Blades to stop this. He began with Rhadamanthus' Trinity Processor's three cores, which gave rise to the three Aegises: Ontos, Logos and Pneuma. While Pneuma and Logos transformed into Pyra/Mythra and Malos, respectively, Ontos vanished into another dimension. The Aegises would continually get information from other Blades about their surroundings, including the surroundings and any feelings they could be feeling. Concurrently, the Core Crystals would get evolutionary data that would impact Blades and Titans in the future. The humans of the old world would eventually be replaced by the new humans thanks to these procedures.</p>
                    
                <p>Klaus gradually came to see how little his inventions were different from the people they replaced. Humans, like their ancestors, looked for explanations for why certain events occurred the way they did. His recognition of these parallels also affected Klaus, who questions whether that quest is a natural human trait. In the end, he refrained from stepping in when Amalthus fled with Pneuma and Logos. All he could do was watch as Malos sought to ruin the planet by letting his wrath loose. Klaus responds that he understood his attempts at atonement were doomed to fail when Rex questions why he decided to do nothing. Klaus considered Rex's relationship with Pneuma comforting, even though he later lost faith in his efforts. Additionally, the Conduit has started to stir again, and with its assistance, the globe might change.</p>

                <p>Malos starts attacking Alrest as Klaus and Rex are talking. Klaus warns Rex that Malos is overwhelmed by Amalthus's ideals and is only an information processor. Before dispatching Rex to vanquish Malos, he grants Pneuma permission to oversee Elysium. Klaus goes on to say that the Conduit, which gives the Aegises their power, will probably also disappear from their realm as he fades. Klaus says he's happy they met as Rex walks away. Klaus thinks back on his former self as Rex departs, intending to eventually confront Galea once more.</p>
                    
                <p>The party then head for Malos, as he gets ready to trigger Aion, the strongest Artifice.</p>
                    
                <p>Rex questions whether Malos or Amalthus made the decision to wipe out the world as he confronts Malos about his actions in the Aion Hangar. After losing everything but his life when they first met, Malos acknowledges that Jin was the source of his intentions. Despite Rex's entreaties, Malos activates Aion, unleashes the station's arsenal of Sirens and other Artifices on Alrest, and confronts the party one more time.</p>
                    
                <p>Malos wonders why Rex is so determined to preserve the planet during their conflict. In response, Rex tells Malos about Jin's last remarks and how the former Torna leader never meant to die but was attempting to establish a relationship with Malos. Rex responds that although forgiveness is challenging, it was the greatest way to continue living when Malos questions him about how he was able to forgive Jin so readily.</p>
                    
                <p>In the alternate reality, Shulk is getting ready to strike Zanza one last time. Klaus encourages Rex to hurry because he knows his time is running out.
                </p>
                    
                <p>Malos is ejected from the Artifice as it explodes after Rex and Pneuma successfully split Aion in two. Klaus then offers Alrest his parting gift as the Conduit starts to fade.</p>
                    
                <p>The Sirens' attack on Alrest likewise stops with the end of Aion. Although he concedes that Rex could only have been the Blade of one Driver, Malos appreciates Rex's skill as he passes away and wishes he had met him sooner. Mòrag comments that Malos has at last discovered a purpose in life as he vanishes.</p>
                    
                <p>Unfortunately, Elysium becomes unstable due to the Conduit's disappearance, and the entire structure starts to fall apart. The World Tree would collapse into Alrest, destroying it in the process, while Rhadamanthus and the ring surrounding the planet would either enter orbit or be launched into space in a gravitational slingshot. Pneuma pauses before responding that there is only one way to save Alrest when Rex asks how. In order to send the World Tree on a different course, avoiding Alrest and launching it out of the planet's gravity well, she leads the group to a chamber where they will fire booster rockets.</p>
                    
                <p>Poppi and Azurda are asked to wait up by Pneuma while the group prepares to launch the rockets. She then requests a favor from Poppi, which surprises both Poppi and Azurda. Poppi is hesitant to accept the request at first, but she eventually agrees after Pneuma reminds her of the commitment they made in Morytha. Then, before the two reach Rex, Pneuma transmits data to Azurda's core.</p>
                    
                <p>The group discovers that Pneuma sent them to a port containing escape pods when Rex arrives at the disputed chamber. For the first time, Pneuma confesses to purposefully lying to him and blocks the port's exit. She informs that the party would need to keep as far away from the World Tree as possible, and that the only way to preserve Alrest is to use the last of Aion's power to destroy it. Unfortunately, Pneuma would also have to give her life in the process. Rex is unable to leave Pneuma and tries to see her in order to stay with her until the last end. He tries to beg Poppi to fly him over after his anchor fails. Poppi grudgingly declines, exposing that Pneuma promised not to assist him because she knew he would ask. The group then convinces Rex to listen to Pneuma, arguing that making such sacrifices is a necessary part of maturing. Pneuma gives Rex the remainder of her Crystal so he can survive without her. Rex changed from his Master Driver suit to his Salvager outfit as the entire crystal dimmed and fell out of his chest.</p>
                    
                <p>Pneuma turns on Aion and obliterates the station in a dazzling display of light as Rex and the group flee. Rex's escape pod is destroyed by the atmospheric compression and debris, but Azurda manages to transform back into his Titan form and saves the group. They discover the Cloud Sea has evaporated and the Titans have vanished as they descend on the planet. The Land of Morytha is all that is left. As they pass through a rift, Azurda finds themselves flying above a huge ocean. The Titans are then discovered in the water, where they combine with an unidentified landmass. As the new continent appears, the group understands what Klaus meant when he said that the world would be restored. Rex sees shooting stars from the Beanstalk and knows they have discovered a real Elysium.</p>
                  
                <p>The Aegis core starts to shine again as the group is in awe at their new world. It emits a green ray of light as it reverts to its initial state, and Pyra and Mythra both manifest on Azurda in different bodies. The remainder of the party watches in surprise as Poppi rushes to welcome Pyra and Mythra upon their return. Nia pushes Rex after a minute, and he moves in the direction of the two Blades.</p>
                    
                    <p>"And thus, boy met girl."</p>
